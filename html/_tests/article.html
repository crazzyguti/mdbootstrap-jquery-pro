        We didn't know it will end up like this.
        
        MDBootstrap.com suppose to be our side project. We were much more interested in automation technologies than web development.
        
        By "we" I mean me and Dawid. It was our third common startup. 
        
        We didn't have any cash. We didn't have an investor nor state or EU funding. We didn't participate in the startup community and we didn't have any contacts. Actually, we didn't have any of this fancy attributes which define a "real startuper".
        
        We were just couple of nerds who can code but let's be honest - that wasn't anything special. There were developers much smarter than we.
        
        What turned out to be the key was that apart from coding, we were pretty good at marketing and automation.
